# HTTP requests via browser `fetch()` API

This is a practice project in which i have created a form to fill movie details which gets
stored in my firebase project, and then we can query all the movie details to display
them in the form of list.

What I learned -
- how to send POST requests via `fetch()` API in React
- how to make GET requests via `fetch()` API in React
- how to handle API requests failure
- how `useEffect()` comes into picture to get data for rendering from backend
